<h3 align="center">Background</h3>

Hi, I'm Scott and I'm a recent Makers Graduate having completed their 16 week (4 weeks pre-course off-site and 12 weeks full time on campus) software development boot camp. Prior to Makers I spent 10 years recruiting for Design Engineers within the construction industry and I was always intrigued by the team related Engineering ethos, where a group of individuals works together as a collective to achieve the end goal of delivering a project within a specific time frame. The more time I spent with these Engineers; sitting in their design and progress meetings, seeing the progression of how an idea becomes a reality, the more I wanted some involvement in this way of working. 
Over the past several years I have also kept an eye on the emergence of the technology sector and its continual growth during those years were the main reasons I decided to switch careers.

Name | Description | Tech | Timeframe | Demo
---| --- | --- | --- | --- |
**[Dinnergy](https://github.com/ocripps24/dinnergy)** | Final group project building a food waste and planning app in Apple's Swift language.

**[Instagram Clone](https://github.com/ocripps24/instagram-clone)** | Following the excitement of building the Netflix clone, I wanted to continue my exploration of Dart / Flutter by creating this clone of the Instagram UI. I learnt several new concepts and felt much more comfortable working with Flutter this time around. | Flutter / Dart | 2-3 days (solo) | <a href="https://youtu.be/mdu1C4mIYps"><img src="Images/youtube.png" width="40"></a> |
**[Netflix Clone](https://github.com/ocripps24/netflix-clone)** | After attending a Flutter meetup, I was excited to see what could be achieved with the language and I wanted to try it myself by building the home page UI of a popular tech service, alongside a tutorial. | Flutter / Dart | 2-3 days (solo) | <a href="https://youtu.be/S_WRuDTjXjw"><img src="Images/youtube.png" width="40"></a> |
