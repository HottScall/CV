<h3 align="center">Background</h3>

Hi, I'm Scott and I'm a recent Makers Graduate having completed their 16 week software development bootcamp. Prior to Makers I spent 10 years recruiting for Design Engineers within the construction industry and I was always intrigued by the team related Engineering ethos, where a group of individuals work together as a collective team to achieve the end goal of delivering a project within a specific time frame. The more time I spent with these Engineers, sitting in their design and progress meetings and see the concept of an idea become a reality, the more I wanted some involvement in this way of working. 
This, along with the my ongoing interest in how software has become more a prominent factor in our daily lives has seen a continual growth of the sector so I eventually decided to make the plunge and change careers to become a Software Developer.
