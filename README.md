<h3 align="center">Background</h3>

Hi, I'm Scott and I'm a recent Makers Graduate having completed their 16 week (4 weeks pre-course off-site and 12 weeks full time on campus) software development boot camp. Prior to Makers I spent 10 years recruiting for Design Engineers within the construction industry and I was always intrigued by the team related Engineering ethos, where a group of individuals works together as a collective to achieve the end goal of delivering a project within a specific time frame. The more time I spent with these Engineers; sitting in their design and progress meetings, seeing the progression of how an idea becomes a reality, the more I wanted some involvement in this way of working. 
Over the past several years I have also kept an eye on the emergence of the technology sector and its continual growth during those years were the main reasons I decided to switch careers.

**[Rhythm is a Maker](https://github.com/shektor/rhythm-is-a-maker)** | Our final group project at Makers Academy. A team of 6 who chose to be in a group which focussed on a music related product decided to build a web application from the ground up which allowed you to create music on the go using our drum loop machine and virtual keyboard. Additional features include Live Chat and Disco Mode for the real party people. My personal involvement on this project was mainly around the front end design with a specific focus on building the Web API keyboard, its volume, and the various sounds effects.| Javascript, Tone.js, Xcode, Jasmine, Karma, Travis, Heroku | 2 weeks (group) | <a href=https://rhythm-is-a-maker.herokuapp.com/><img src="Images/heroku.png" width='40'></a> |
**[Bearbook](https://github.com/ocripps24/Acebook-The-Brave-Bears)** | A two-week group project whereby a team 6 Junior Developers had to build a basic version of Facebook from scratch using Ruby on Rails, a previously unused programming Tech Stack. We were presented with a client brief which we broke down into relevant User Stories which we assigned to pairs. For the initial Rails, Database and CI/CD set up we all mobbed together to ensure we had an involvement around project set up. My specific involvement on the project focused around creating new posts linked to users which showed on the timeline in a “newest post first” order and then adding usernames and timestamps to each post. | Ruby on Rails, RSpec, Capybara, Travis, Rubocop, PSQL | 2 weeks (group) | <a href="http://acebook-the-brave-bears.herokuapp.com/"><img src="Images/heroku.png" width='40'></a> |
**[Ruby'N'B](https://github.com/Kintaro-Oe/MakersBnB)** | Our first group project at Makers where we has one week to build a clone of Air B’n’B based on a number of predetermined user stories. I was specifically involved in building the functionality where users can request bookings and ensuring that booking requests were received by the property owner. I also modelling the relational database and basic model diagram of how the basic flow of the app would work, see repo home page for diagrams | Ruby, Rspec, PSQL, Sinatra, Capybara | 1 week (group) | <a href="https://makers-bnb-oliver.herokuapp.com/"><img src="Images/heroku.png" width='40'></a> |

<h4 align="center">Strong Communicator</h4>
           
Strong Communicator - Prior to Makers I spent 10 years in recruitment, 5 years in an external agency and 5 years for a multinational Construction Engineering Consultancy. I have worked with hiring partners anywhere from Principal Engineer to Divisional Director and I feel comfortable with communication with people at all levels within a company organisation. I also undertand the importance of delivering quality, detailed feedback which focusses on both the positives of somebodies work, but also the area’s of improvement. I also feel comfortable that I can explain detailed technical information in a way that non technical people can understand. An example of this would be on our Brave Bears project, we had all split into pairs and were working on specific parts of a project when a number of team members were concerned about not understanding the other area’s they weren’t working on. I organised an evening retro where we wrote down all areas of improvements including organising a team based meeting to discuss what we have each built and how it was built so that all team members had a good overview of what was being built, how it was built and why. See here for details of that <a href="https://github.com/CarlyJ88/Acebook-The-Brave-Bears/wiki/Day-5-Retro">standup</a>
